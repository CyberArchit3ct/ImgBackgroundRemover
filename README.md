# ImgBackgroundRemover
This is an image background remover based on tkinter.  This package protects all of your data by operating solely on your host computer.  It is a very light program that works with practically any type of machine that has Python installed.
Here is a **very simple and minimalist `README.md`** file explaining how to run your program.

-----

This is a simple Python script that uses the `WithoutBG` library to remove the background from an image.

-----

##  Prerequisites

You need **Python** installed on your system.

-----

##  Installation

1.  **Save the Code:** Save the Python code named `app.py`.

2.  **Install Dependencies:** You need to install the required libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

-----

##  How to Run

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.

2.  Navigate to the directory where you saved `app.py`.

3.  Run the script:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4.  When an image selection dialog box appears, you must select the image whose background you wish to erase.

5.  The application will run and save the background-removed image as `filename_no_bg.png`.
